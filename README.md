```
- Complain 

the issues tab

# Known issues
- Some illustrations does not have their thumbnail displaying as pixiv randomly closes the cdn connection
TODO: retry
- ~~newly-implemented ugoira displaying method currently doesn't work~~ i deleted it. Its last existence is on [this commit](https://github.com/HenrySck075/pxmaterial/commit/98ac1836241f2a8908af751faf8882d349021e9e)
- ~~`keyReservation.contains(key) is not true`~~ i fixed it by using replace. obviously the drawback is that if you're in any of the home page, pressing back wont take you back to the previous page

## TODO
- Figure out how to reasonably add more animations 
- Commenting the JSON payloads 
- App screenshots in README
