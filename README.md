## Known issues
- Some illustrations does not have their thumbnail displaying, instead it's a box
+ It's also kinda weird for me, like we should be able to spam the CDN with no issues whatsoever.
the error is `Connection closed before full header was received`.

You shouldn't really care about it tho since if you reload it will just load the thumbnail like normal
TODO: retry
- newly-implemented ugoira displaying method currently doesn't work

## TODO
- Skeletonizer
